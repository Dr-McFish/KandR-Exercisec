## About

This repo contains my attempts to solve the exercises from the book: *The C Programing Language \| Second Edition* by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie

### My setup:

 - Windows 10
 - gcc comiler form [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
 - terminal: [git bash](https://git-scm.com) 
 - text editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) 
 - Note: I will be using the ANSI/c89 standard to keep inline with the book. I think it would be easier and less confusing to first learn that first, and only after that learn about new/moddern features, to decide what I realy need and to keep in mind what belongs where
